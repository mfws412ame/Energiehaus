    "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or<br>

    <br>
    "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object<br>
    form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the<br>
    editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications<br>
    represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes<br>
    of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain<br>

    the Work and Derivative Works thereof.<br>
    <br>
    "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including<br>

    this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,<br>
    worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable<br>
    copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,<br>

    <br>
    3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of<br>

    (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,<br>
    use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,<br>

    by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their<br>
    Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)<br>
    with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You<br>
    institute patent litigation against any entity (including a<br>
    cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work<br>
    or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct<br>
    or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses<br>
    granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate<br>
    as of the date such litigation is filed.<br>
    <br>
    4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the<br>
    Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without<br>
    modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You<br>
    meet the following conditions:<br>
    <br>
    (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or<br>
    Derivative Works a copy of this License; and<br>
    <br>
    (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices<br>
    stating that You changed the files; and<br>
    <br>
    (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works<br>
    that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and<br>
    attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,<br>
    excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of<br>
    the Derivative Works; and<br>
    <br>
    (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its<br>
    distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must<br>
    include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained<br>
    within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not<br>
    pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one<br>
    of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed<br>
    as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or<br>
    documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,<br>
    within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and<br>
    wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents<br>
    of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and<br>
    do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution<br>
    notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside<br>
    or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided<br>
    that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed<br>
    as modifying the License.<br>
    <br>
    You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and<br>
    may provide additional or different license terms and conditions<br>
    for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or<br>
    for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,<br>
    reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with<br>
    the conditions stated in this License.<br>
    <br>
    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,<br>
    any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work<br>
    by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of<br>
    this License, without any additional terms or conditions.<br>
    Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify<br>
    the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed<br>
    with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br>
    <br>
    6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade<br>
    names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,<br>
    except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the<br>
    origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.<br>
    <br>
    7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or<br>
    agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each<br>
    Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,<br>
    WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or<br>
    implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions<br>
    of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A<br>
    PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the<br>
    appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any<br>
    risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br>
    <br>
    8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br>
    whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br>
    unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly<br>
    negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br>
    liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br>
    incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br>
    result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the<br>
    Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br>
    work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br>
    other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br>
    has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br>
    <br>
    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br>
    the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br>
    and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br>
    or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br>
    License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br>
    on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br>
    of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br>
    defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br>
    incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br>
    of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br>
    <br>
